+ Project summary: In this project, we basically analyze how STEM policy influences the whole American Society, including the citizens and the non-citizens. Our analysis contains three parts: (1) how does STEM policy influences college students, especially international students, (2) how does STEM policy influences graduated students, and (3) how does STEM policy influences employment situation. For part (1) and part (2), we use several data sets of recent years to obtain the trends of the major selections of college students and the employment rates of graduated students. Also, we show how international students distribute all over the United States to try to understand the relationship between geographic factors and STEM fields and how graduated students distribute in different fields to try to understand whether STEM-major students finally find jobs in STEM fields. For part (3), we use data sets from 2007 and 2014 in order to compare the employment situations before and after the STEM policy. During the analyzing process, we clean our data sets, do exploratory data analysis, do some prediction, visualize our data, etc. We hope this project will leave a deep impression to the class.
