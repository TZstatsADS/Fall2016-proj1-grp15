+ Project summary: In this project, we basically analyze how STEM policy influences the whole American Society, including the citizens and the non-citizens. Our analysis contains two parts: (1) how does STEM policy influences graduated students, and (2) how does STEM policy influences employment situation. For part (1), we first use several data sets of recent years to obtain the trends of the employment rates of graduated students. Then, we concentrate on the data set of 2014 to study the employment rates of different levels of degrees, the top majors in both STEM field and non-STEM field, the top fields that STEM students will enter and non-STEM students will enter, and the top fields that students from top STEM and non-STEM majors will enter. Through our analysis of part 1, we finally get a general idea about the influences of STEM policy on graduated students. For part (2), we use data sets from 2007 and 2014 in order to compare the employment situations before and after the STEM policy. For example, we analyze whether the geographical distribution changes for STEM employees and non-STEM employees, we analyze how working conditions change, etc. Through our analysis of part 2, we finally get a general idea about the influences of STEM policy on employment situation. During the analyzing process, we clean our data sets, do exploratory data analysis, do some prediction, visualize our data, etc. We hope this project will leave a deep impression to the class.
